26,,0,0,7,,The Adstock model is defined as:,,,
27,,0,0,6,,Where,,,Ai  = Adstock in period i
28,,0,0,6,,,,,Mi = Media input in period i
29,,0,0,5,,,,,ß    = Decay rate (0≤  ß  <1)
30,,0,0,5,,,,,Ai-1 = Adstock in period i-1
31,,0,0,4,,Decay should be estimated directly on data,,,
32,,0,0,4,,,,,
33,,0,0,3,,Different adstock variables should be estimated on differetn media groups and on different creative universes,,,
